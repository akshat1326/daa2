This code implements the implementation of finding the strongly connected compopnents using Kosarajus algorithm. The input is taken by .txt file in the function which creates an instance of the graph and finds strongly connected components using graph class functions. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}

The algorithm we are typing to implement is as follows\+:~\newline
1) Create an empty stack S and do DFS traversal of a graph. In DFS traversal, after calling recursive DFS for adjacent vertices of a vertex, push the vertex to stack. In the above graph.~\newline
2) Reverse directions of all arcs to obtain the transpose graph(we have used adj\+T for this purpose).~\newline
3) One by one pop a vertex from S while S is not empty. Let the popped vertex be v. Take v as source and do DFS. The DFS starting from v prints strongly connected component of v.~\newline
